### 5CSM Progress Report 2018-12-02

(1) The major discovery made since the last report is that, calling syscall ```__NR_BRK_``` will cause seg fault AFTER returning from ```_start1``` (jonesforth) to the C caller function ( main() ).

As such, these changes are made in [jonesforth9e.S](https://github.com/udexon/5CSM/blob/master/jonesforth9e.S):

i. Disable ```call set_up_data_segment``` ( line 583 )

ii. Replace (i) with C malloc ```(char *) FDSEG``` (Forth Data Segment) to define var_HERE (line 575). 

iii. Doing so solved one problem but leave another unsolved:

a. ```cat jonesforth.f d.f | jonesforth9e``` now works.

b. ```cat jonesforth.f c.f | jonesforth9e``` still does not work, giving seg fault.

To compile the above:
```gcc -m32 -o sj9e sj.c jonesforth9e.S -g array.s```
