### 5CSM Progress Report 2018-12-03

(1) The problem is solved by calling ```_start1()``` (jonesforth entry point) in a subfunction, not from main(), so that main's stack is not corrupted.

Although this solution is less than perfect, hopefully it will attract more C programmers to Forth -- and they will solve the remaining problem in the future.

```
$ gcc -m32 -o sn10a sn.c jonesforth10a.S -g array.s
