5CSM Progress Report 2018-11-30

(1) The original jonesforth.S file is at:
https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S

(2) I have made some changes to it and upload to:
https://github.com/udexon/5CSM/blob/master/jonesforth2.S

The changes are:
(i) line 565, 566: _start changed to _start1 
-- so that it could be compiled with a .c program, which uses the _start symbol

(ii) _start1() can now be called from a C program, as entry point to jonesforth:
https://github.com/udexon/5CSM/blob/master/sg.c

(iii) To compile jonesforth:
$ gcc -m32 -o sg sg.c jf/jonesforth2.S

Note: sg is simply a short name for my test program. s for "stack machine". g is the version.

(iv) To execute jonesforth:
$ cat jf/jonesforth.f c.f | ./sg
